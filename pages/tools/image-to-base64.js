                                Base64 is an encoding algorithm that converts any characters, binary data, and even images or sound files into a readable string, which can be saved or transported over the network without data loss. The characters generated from Base64 encoding consist of Latin letters, digits, plus, and slash.

                            <h5 className="answer">
                                From wiki: “Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with textual data. This is to ensure that the data remains intact without modification during transport”.

                            <h4 className='question'>How file converted to base64?</h4>
                            <h5 className="answer">
                                Base64 encoding takes the original binary data and operates on it by dividing it into tokens of three bytes. A byte consists of eight bits, so Base64 takes 24bits in total. These 3 bytes are then converted into four printable characters from the ASCII standard.
                                <br /><br />
                                The first step is to take the three bytes (24bit) of binary data and split it into four numbers of six bits. Because the ASCII standard defines the use of seven bits, Base64 only uses 6 bits (corresponding to 2^6 = 64 characters) to ensure the encoded data is printable and none of the special characters available in ASCII are used. The algorithm's name Base64 comes from the use of these 64 ASCII characters. The ASCII characters used for Base64 are the numbers 0-9, the alphabets 26 lowercase and 26 uppercase characters plus two extra characters '+' and '/'.

PNG is in a class of high quality image file types that retain all information and quality. However, Especially for businesses, JPG is superior because it plays a role in building websites.

                                When a company builds its webpage, it knows the importance of keeping customers on the page. If a page takes too long to load, the customer leaves. This is why organizations convert PNG files to JPG. It creates a more compact image for websites, letting older computers and slower internet users view the site as well as others with superior connections. */}

                                Further, online converters make assurances to keep your information safe but do you really want to take the chance with sensitive and private files?<br /><br />
