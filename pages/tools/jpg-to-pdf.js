                                The primary use of JPEGs is for images, whereas PDFs can handle all sorts of text and image-based documents. Because JPEGs compress image data, its file sizes tend to be relatively small. This means that it's a convenient way to share digital images over the web and email.

                                The only difference between .jpg and .jpeg stems from early versions of Windows and DOS that limited file extension types to just three letters. Therefore, you can convert your photos into either file format to take advantage of their bright colors and small file sizes. Using JPEG images is just one of the ways you can improve your website load times. By partnering with a host such as WP Engine, you can optimize your entire site for performance.

                                {/* Consider converting your image file from PNG to JPG if you need a smaller file size. There are many reasons you might need an image file to be shrunken down. PNG is in a class of high quality image file types that retain all information and quality. However, Especially for businesses, JPG is superior because it plays a role in building websites.

                                When a company builds its webpage, it knows the importance of keeping customers on the page. If a page takes too long to load, the customer leaves. This is why organizations convert PNG files to JPG. It creates a more compact image for websites, letting older computers and slower internet users view the site as well as others with superior connections. */}
