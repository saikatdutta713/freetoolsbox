                                The PNG file format is widely used on websites to display high-quality digital images. Created to exceed the performance of GIF files, PNGs offer not just lossless compression, but also a much broader and brighter color palette.

                            <h5 className="answer">
                                If you are using a screenshot or a PNG image, it will default to have a transparent background. If you are using a JPG or other file format, you'll need to adjust your background color in the Snagit editor first or it will default to white rather than transparent.
                                {/* Consider converting your image file from PNG to JPG if you need a smaller file size. There are many reasons you might need an image file to be shrunken down. PNG is in a class of high quality image file types that retain all information and quality. However, Especially for businesses, JPG is superior because it plays a role in building websites.

                                When a company builds its webpage, it knows the importance of keeping customers on the page. If a page takes too long to load, the customer leaves. This is why organizations convert PNG files to JPG. It creates a more compact image for websites, letting older computers and slower internet users view the site as well as others with superior connections. */}

                            <h5 className="answer">
                                A PNG is meant to be a high quality file that loses resolution only when it's time to edit it. Unfortunately, in order to edit it extensively, it needs to be converted into a more manageable file type. There are a lot of extensions that allow for further editing but Illustrator is a lot more complex.

                                Not all PNG files have transparency capability. For example, the PNG that you get from a screen shot does not. Even a PNG from Photoshop will not have transparency capability unless you check the transparency box. As I understand it, 8 bit and 24 bit do not have transparency capability, but 32 bit does.

                                JPEG can't support transparency because it uses RGB color space. If you want transparency use a format that supports alpha values.

                                online file converters promises first priority of users privacy and safety but can you trust them?  Most converters require you to upload your file to their server and then download the converted file, leaving you open to the possibility of carrying viruses and trojans to your computer.<br /><br />
                                Further, online converters make assurances to keep your information safe but do you really want to take the chance with sensitive and private files?<br /><br />

                                Freetoolsbox file converters are  absolutely safe to use because it don't use server to process files, no need to upload any file to the server, all files are converted in your bowser at your side only.
