                                PNG is short for Portable Network Graphic, a type of raster image file. It’s particularly popular file type with web designers because it can handle graphics with transparent or semi-transparent backgrounds. The file format isn’t patented, so you can open a PNG using any image editing software without the need for licensing.
                                <br /><br />
                                PNG files, which use the '.png' extension, can handle 16 million colours — which definitely sets them apart from most file types.

                            <h5 className="answer">
                                PNG is a bitmap format, PDF is a richer format which may include vector data (including text). For scaling PDF is much better.

                                PNG is also a top choice if images will be edited and saved multiple times. PDF images are ideal for printing, especially for graphic design, posters, and flyers. PDF images are also an ideal choice for storing images online when you intend them to be downloaded.

                            <h5 className="answer">
                                PNG is a popular bitmap image format on the Internet. It is short for “Portable Graphics Format”. This format was created as an alternative of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF).

                                {/* Consider converting your image file from PNG to JPG if you need a smaller file size. There are many reasons you might need an image file to be shrunken down. PNG is in a class of high quality image file types that retain all information and quality. However, Especially for businesses, JPG is superior because it plays a role in building websites.
                                <br /><br />

                                When a company builds its webpage, it knows the importance of keeping customers on the page. If a page takes too long to load, the customer leaves. This is why organizations convert PNG files to JPG. It creates a more compact image for websites, letting older computers and slower internet users view the site as well as others with superior connections. */}

                                online file converters promises first priority of users privacy and safety but can you trust them?
